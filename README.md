## General Information
- Use jupyter-notebook with ASE to make supercell, slabs and all kind of structures from experimental unit cell of perovskites 
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Building structures


## Codes Used
Project is created with:
* VASP:
* Nequip:
  
## Usage
