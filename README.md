## General Information
- Use jupyter-notebook with ASE to make supercell, slabs and all kind of structures from experimental unit cell of perovskites 
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Building structures


## Codes Used
Project is created with:
* ASE: 
* Jupyter-notebooks: 
* AIIDA: 
* VASP:

  
## Usage
- Lammmps set up
- ASE set up

## Features
- Melting & crystallization of CsPbBr3
- Brute force solid-solid phase transitions by co-existing simulations of CsPbI3
- Various Polytypes of FAPbI3
- Thermal conductivity of CsSnI3 at different temperaturatures
- Crystallization of narrow-band-gap perovskites
- Crystallization of wide-band-gap perovskites

## Ongoing 
- Mixed organic-inorganic perovskites
- Quasi-2D perovskites
- Solvent mixtures
- Crystal growth from solutions
